### Quick Install

1. Install the **starship** binary:


   #### Install Latest Version

   With Shell:

   ```
   To update the Starship itself, rerun the above script. It will replace the current version without touching Starship's configuration.


   #### Install via Package Manager

   ```sh
   brew install starship
   ```

   With [Scoop](https://scoop.sh):

   ```powershell
   scoop install starship
   ```
