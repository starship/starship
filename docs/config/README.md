# Configuration

::: tip
🔥 Configuration is currently being worked on.
Many new configuration options will be available in coming releases.
:::

To get started configuring starship, create the following file: `~/.config/starship.toml`.

```shell
$ touch ~/.config/starship.toml
```

All configuration for starship is done in this [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file:

```toml
# Don't print a new line at the start of the prompt
add_newline = false

# Replace the "➜" symbol in the prompt with "❯"
[character]      # The name of the module we are confguring is "character"
symbol = "❯"     # The "symbol" segment is being set to "❯"

# Disable the package module, hiding it from the prompt completely
[package]
disabled = true
```

### Terminology

**Module**: A component in the prompt giving information based on contextual information from your OS. For example, the "nodejs" module shows the version of NodeJS that is currently installed on your computer, if your current directory is a NodeJS project.

**Segment**: Smaller sub-components that compose a module. For example, the "symbol" segment in the "nodejs" module contains the character that is shown before the version number (⬢ by default).

Here is the representation of the node module. In the following example, "symbol" and "version"
are segments within it. Every module also has a prefix and suffix that are the default terminal color.

```
[prefix]      [symbol]     [version]    [suffix]
 "via "         "⬢"        "v10.4.1"       ""
```

## Prompt

This is the list of prompt-wide configuration options.

### Options

| Variable      | Default | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `add_newline` | `true`  | Add a new line before the start of the prompt. |

### Example

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml

# Disable the newline at the start of the prompt
add_newline = false
```

## Battery

The `battery` module shows how charged the device's battery is and its current charging status.
The module is only visible when the device's battery is below 10%.

### Options

| Variable             | Default | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `full_symbol`        | `"•"`   | The symbol shown when the battery is full.        |
| `charging_symbol`    | `"⇡"`   | The symbol shown when the battery is charging.    |
| `discharging_symbol` | `"⇣"`   | The symbol shown when the battery is discharging. |
| `disabled`           | `false` | Disables the `battery` module.                    |

### Example

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml

[battery]
full_symbol = "🔋"
charging_symbol = "⚡️"
discharging_symbol = "💀"
```

## Character

The `character` module shows a character (usually an arrow) beside where the text
is entered in your terminal.

The character will tell you whether the last command was successful or not. It 
can do this in two ways: by changing color (red/green) or by changing its shape 
(➜/✖). The latter will only be done if `use_symbol_for_status` is set to `true`.

### Options

| Variable   | Default | Description                                          |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `symbol`                | `"➜"`   | The symbol used before the text input in the prompt. |
| `error_symbol`          | `"✖"`   | The symbol used before text input if the previous command failed. |
| `use_symbol_for_status` | `false` | Indicate error status by changing the symbol.         |
| `disabled`              | `false` | Disables the `character` module.                      |

### Example

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml

[character]
symbol = "❯"
error_symbol = "✗"
use_symbol_for_status = true
```

## Command Duration

The `cmd_duration` module shows how long the last command took to execute.
The module will be shown only if the command took longer than two seconds, or
the `min_time` config value, if it exists.

::: warning NOTE
Command duration is currently not supported in `bash`. See
[this issue](https://github.com/starship/starship/issues/124) for more details.
:::

### Options

| Variable   | Default | Description                         |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `min_time` | `2`     | Shortest duration to show time for. |
| `disabled` | `false` | Disables the `cmd_duration` module. |

### Example

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml

[cmd_duration]
min_time = 4
```

## Directory

The `directory` module shows the path to your current directory, truncated to
three parent folders. Your directory will also be truncated to the root of the
git repo that you're currently in.

### Options

| Variable            | Default | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `truncation_length` | `3`     | The number of parent folders that the current directory should be truncated to. |
| `disabled`          | `false` | Disables the `directory` module.                                                |
