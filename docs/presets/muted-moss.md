# Muted Moss Preset

This preset was creted by [Ryan Collins](https://github.com/rymcol). It is a pleasant green color palette meant to blend slightly into the background to provide minimal distraction, but still with plenty of useful information. Loosely based off the Tokyo Night rounding with better os symbol support and a number of other features pre-enabled.
