# No Nerd Fonts Preset

This preset restricts the use of symbols to those from emoji and powerline sets.

This means that even without a Nerd Font installed, you should be able to view all module symbols.

This preset will become the default preset in a future release of starship.

### 설정

```sh
starship preset no-nerd-font -o ~/.config/starship.toml
```
