# Configurazione

To get started configuring starship, create the following file: `~/.config/starship.toml`.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config && touch ~/.config/starship.toml
```

All configuration for starship is done in this [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file:

```toml
# Inserts a blank line between shell prompts
add_newline = true

# Replace the "❯" symbol in the prompt with "➜"
[character]                            # The name of the module we are configuring is "character"
success_symbol = "[➜](bold green)"     # The "success_symbol" segment is being set to "➜" with the color "bold green"

# Disable the package module, hiding it from the prompt completely
[package]
disabled = true
```

You can change default configuration file location with `STARSHIP_CONFIG` environment variable:

```sh
export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/.starship/config.toml
```

Equivalently in PowerShell (Windows) would be adding this line to your `$PROFILE`:

```powershell
$ENV:STARSHIP_CONFIG = "$HOME\.starship\config.toml"
```

### Logging

By default starship logs warnings and errors into a file named `~/.cache/starship/session_${STARSHIP_SESSION_KEY}.log`, where the session key is corresponding to a instance of your terminal. This, however can be changed using the `STARSHIP_CACHE` environment variable:

```sh
export STARSHIP_CACHE=~/.starship/cache
```

Equivalently in PowerShell (Windows) would be adding this line to your `$PROFILE`:

```powershell
$ENV:STARSHIP_CACHE = "$HOME\AppData\Local\Temp"
```

### Terminology

**Module**: A component in the prompt giving information based on contextual information from your OS. For example, the "nodejs" module shows the version of NodeJS that is currently installed on your computer, if your current directory is a NodeJS project.

**Variable**: Smaller sub-components that contain information provided by the module. For example, the "version" variable in the "nodejs" module contains the current version of NodeJS.

By convention, most modules have a prefix of default terminal color (e.g. `via` in "nodejs") and an empty space as a suffix.

### Format Strings

Format strings are the format that a module prints all its variables with. Most modules have an entry called `format` that configures the display format of the module. You can use texts, variables and text groups in a format string.

#### Variable

A variable contains a `$` symbol followed by the name of the variable. The name of a variable only contains letters, numbers and `_`.

For example:

- `$version` is a format string with a variable named `version`.
- `$git_branch$git_commit` is a format string with two variables named `git_branch` and `git_commit`.
- `$git_branch $git_commit` has the two variables separated with a space.

#### Text Group

A text group is made up of two different parts.

The first part, which is enclosed in a `[]`, is a [format string](#format-strings). You can add texts, variables, or even nested text groups in it.

In the second part, which is enclosed in a `()`, is a [style string](#style-strings). This can be used style the first part.

For example:

- `[on](red bold)` will print a string `on` with bold text colored red.
- `[⌘ $version](bold green)` will print a symbol `⌘` followed by the content of variable `version`, with bold text colored green.
- `[a [b](red) c](green)` will print `a b c` with `b` red, and `a` and `c` green.

#### Stringhe di stile

Most modules in starship allow you to configure their display styles. This is done with an entry (usually called `style`) which is a string specifying the configuration. Here are some examples of style strings along with what they do. For details on the full syntax, consult the [advanced config guide](/advanced-config/).

- `"fg:green bg:blue"` sets green text on a blue background
- `"bg:blue fg:bright-green"` sets bright green text on a blue background
- `"bold fg:27"` sets bold text with [ANSI color](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KTSQa.png) 27
- `"underline bg:#bf5700"` sets underlined text on a burnt orange background
- `"bold italic fg:purple"` sets bold italic purple text
- `""` explicitly disables all styling

Note that what styling looks like will be controlled by your terminal emulator. For example, some terminal emulators will brighten the colors instead of bolding text, and some color themes use the same values for the normal and bright colors. Also, to get italic text, your terminal must support italics.

#### Conditional Format Strings

A conditional format string wrapped in `(` and `)` will not render if all variables inside are empty.

For example:

- `(@$region)` will show nothing if the variable `region` is `None`, otherwise `@` followed by the value of region.
- `(some text)` will always show nothing since there are no variables wrapped in the braces.
- When `$all` is a shortcut for `\[$a$b\]`, `($all)` will show nothing only if `$a` and `$b` are both `None`. This works the same as `(\[$a$b\] )`.

#### Escapable characters

The following symbols have special usage in a format string. If you want to print the following symbols, you have to escape them with a backslash (`\`).

- \$
- \\
- [
- ]
- (
- )

Note that `toml` has [its own escape syntax](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#user-content-string). It is recommended to use a literal string (`''`) in your config. If you want to use a basic string (`""`), pay attention to escape the backslash `\`.

For example, when you want to print a `$` symbol on a new line, the following configs for `format` are equivalent:

```toml
# with basic string
format = "\n\\$"

# with multiline basic string
format = """

\\$"""

# with literal string
format = '''

\$'''
```

## Prompt

This is the list of prompt-wide configuration options.

## AWS

The `aws` module shows the current AWS region and profile. This is based on `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, and `AWS_PROFILE` env var with `~/.aws/config` file.

When using [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) the profile is read from the `AWS_VAULT` env var.

When using [awsu](https://github.com/kreuzwerker/awsu) the profile is read from the `AWSU_PROFILE` env var.

| `disabled`           | `false`                           | Disables the `battery` module.                      |


### Example

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml

[battery]
full_symbol = "🔋"
charging_symbol = "⚡️"
discharging_symbol = "💀"
```

### Battery Display

The `display` configuration option is used to define when the battery indicator should be shown (threshold) and what it looks like (style). If no `display` is provided. The default is as shown:

```toml
[[battery.display]]
threshold = 10
style = "bold red"
```

#### Options

The `display` option is an array of the following table.

| Option      | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `threshold` | The upper bound for the display option.         |
| `style`     | The style used if the display option is in use. |

#### Example

```toml
[[battery.display]]  # "bold red" style when capacity is between 0% and 10%
threshold = 10
style = "bold red"

[[battery.display]]  # "bold yellow" style when capacity is between 10% and 30%
threshold = 30
style = "bold yellow"

# when capacity is over 30%, the battery indicator will not be displayed

```

## Character

The `character` module shows a character (usually an arrow) beside where the text is entered in your terminal.

The character will tell you whether the last command was successful or not. It can do this in two ways:

- changing color (`red`/`green`)
- changing shape (`❯`/`✖`)

By default it only changes color. If you also want to change it's shape take a look at [this example](#with-custom-error-shape).

::: warning `error_symbol` is not supported on elvish shell. :::

| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `format`         | `"$symbol "`        | The format string used before the text input.                                    |
| `success_symbol` | `"[❯](bold green)"` | The format string used before the text input if the previous command succeeded.  |
| `error_symbol`   | `"[❯](bold red)"`   | The format string used before the text input if the previous command failed.     |
| `vicmd_symbol`   | `"[❮](bold green)"` | The format string used before the text input if the shell is in vim normal mode. |
| `disabled`       | `false`             | Disables the `character` module.                                                 |

### Variables

| Variable | Example | Description                                                           |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| symbol   |         | A mirror of either `success_symbol`, `error_symbol` or `vicmd_symbol` |

### Examples

#### With custom error shape

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml

| symbol    |           | Mirrors the value of option `symbol` |
| style\* |           | Mirrors the value of option `style`  |

\*: This variable can only be used as a part of a style string

## Command Duration

The `cmd_duration` module shows how long the last command took to execute. The module will be shown only if the command took longer than two seconds, or the `min_time` config value, if it exists.

::: warning Do not hook the DEBUG trap in Bash

If you are running Starship in `bash`, do not hook the `DEBUG` trap after running `eval $(starship init $0)`, or this module **will** break.

:::

Bash users who need preexec-like functionality can use [rcaloras's bash_preexec framework](https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec). Simply define the arrays `preexec_functions` and `precmd_functions` before running `eval $(starship init $0)`, and then proceed as normal.

### Options

| Option               | Default                       | Description                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `min_time`           | `2_000`                       | Shortest duration to show time for (in milliseconds).      |
| `show_milliseconds`  | `false`                       | Show milliseconds in addition to seconds for the duration. |
| `format`             | `"took [$duration]($style) "` | The format for the module.                                 |
| `style`              | `"bold yellow"`               | The style for the module.                                  |
| `disabled`           | `false`                       | Disables the `cmd_duration` module.                        |
| `show_notifications` | `false`                       | Show desktop notifications when command completes.         |
| `min_time_to_notify` | `45_000`                      | Shortest duration for notification (in milliseconds).      |

::: tip

Showing desktop notifications requires starship to be built with `rust-notify` support. You check if your starship supports notifications by running `STARSHIP_LOG=debug starship module cmd_duration -d 60000` when `show_notifications` is set to `true`.

### Variables

| Variable  | Example  | Description                             |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| duration  | `16m40s` | The time it took to execute the command |
| style\* |          | Mirrors the value of option `style`     |

\*: This variable can only be used as a part of a style string

### Example

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml

[cmd_duration]
min_time = 500
format = "underwent [$duration](bold yellow)"
```

## Conda

The `conda` module shows the current conda environment, if `$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV` is set.

::: tip

This does not suppress conda's own prompt modifier, you may want to run `conda config --set changeps1 False`.

## Directory

The `directory` module shows the path to your current directory, truncated to three parent folders. Your directory will also be truncated to the root of the git repo that you're currently in.

When using the fish style pwd option, instead of hiding the path that is truncated, you will see a shortened name of each directory based on the number you enable for the option.

For example, given `~/Dev/Nix/nixpkgs/pkgs` where `nixpkgs` is the repo root, and the option set to `1`. You will now see `~/D/N/nixpkgs/pkgs`, whereas before it would have been `nixpkgs/pkgs`.

### Options

| Option              | Default                                            | Description                                                                      |

| `truncation_symbol` | `""`                                               | The symbol to prefix to truncated paths. eg: "…/"                                |

<details>
<summary>This module has a few advanced configuration options that control how the directory is displayed.</summary>

| Advanced Option             | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `substitutions`             |         | A table of substitutions to be made to the path.                                                                                                                       |
| `fish_style_pwd_dir_length` | `0`     | The number of characters to use when applying fish shell pwd path logic.                                                                                               |
| `use_logical_path`          | `true`  | If `true` render the logical path sourced from the shell via `PWD` or `--logical-path`. If `false` instead render the physical filesystem path with symlinks resolved. |

`substitutions` allows you to define arbitrary replacements for literal strings that occur in the path, for example long network prefixes or development directories (i.e. Java). Note that this will disable the fish style PWD.

```toml
[directory.substitutions]
"/Volumes/network/path" = "/net"
"src/com/long/java/path" = "mypath"
```

`fish_style_pwd_dir_length` interacts with the standard truncation options in a way that can be surprising at first: if it's non-zero, the components of the path that would normally be truncated are instead displayed with that many characters. For example, the path `/built/this/city/on/rock/and/roll`, which would normally be displayed as as `rock/and/roll`, would be displayed as `/b/t/c/o/rock/and/roll` with `fish_style_pwd_dir_length = 1`--the path components that would normally be removed are displayed with a single character. For `fish_style_pwd_dir_length = 2`, it would be `/bu/th/ci/on/rock/and/roll`.

## Dotnet

The `dotnet` module shows the relevant version of the .NET Core SDK for the current directory. If the SDK has been pinned in the current directory, the pinned version is shown. Otherwise the module shows the latest installed version of the SDK.

By default this module will only be shown in your prompt when one or more of the following files are present in the current directory:

- `global.json`
- `project.json`
- `Directory.Build.props`
- `Directory.Build.targets`
- `Packages.props`
- `*.sln`
- `*.csproj`
- `*.fsproj`
- `*.xproj`

You'll also need the .NET Core SDK installed in order to use it correctly.

Internally, this module uses its own mechanism for version detection. Typically it is twice as fast as running `dotnet --version`, but it may show an incorrect version if your .NET project has an unusual directory layout. If accuracy is more important than speed, you can disable the mechanism by setting `heuristic = false` in the module options.

The module will also show the Target Framework Moniker (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/frameworks#supported-target-framework-versions>) when there is a csproj file in the current directory.

::: tip

The `python_binary` variable accepts either a string or a list of strings. Starship will try executing each binary until it gets a result. Note you can only change the binary that Starship executes to get the version of Python not the arguments that are used.

The default values and order for `python_binary` was chosen to first identify the Python version in a virtualenv/conda environments (which currently still add a `python`, no matter if it points to `python3` or `python2`). This has the side effect that if you still have a system Python 2 installed, it may be picked up before any Python 3 (at least on Linux Distros that always symlink `/usr/bin/python` to Python 2). If you do not work with Python 2 anymore but cannot remove the system Python 2, changing this to `"python3"` will hide any Python version 2, see example below.

## Swift

By default the `swift` module shows the currently installed version of Swift. The module will be shown if any of the following conditions are met:

- The current directory contains a `Package.swift` file
- The current directory contains a file with the `.swift` extension

### Options

| Option              | Default                              | Description                                      |

format = "via [🏎  $version](red bold)"
```

## Terraform

The `terraform` module shows the currently selected terraform workspace and version.

::: tip

By default the terraform version is not shown, since this is slow for current versions of terraform when a lot of plugins are in use. If you still want to enable it, [follow the example shown below](#with-version).

:::

By default the module will be shown if any of the following conditions are met:

- The current directory contains a `.terraform` folder
- Current directory contains a file with the `.tf` or `.hcl` extensions

### Options

[terraform]
format = "[🏎💨 $version$workspace]($style) "
```

#### Without version

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml

[terraform]
format = "[🏎💨 $workspace]($style) "
```

## Time

The `time` module shows the current **local** time. The `format` configuration value is used by the [`chrono`](https://crates.io/crates/chrono) crate to control how the time is displayed. Take a look [at the chrono strftime docs](https://docs.rs/chrono/0.4.7/chrono/format/strftime/index.html) to see what options are available.

::: tip

This module is disabled by default. To enable it, set `disabled` to `false` in your configuration file.

```

## Username

The `username` module shows active user's username. The module will be shown if any of the following conditions are met:

- The current user is root
- The current user isn't the same as the one that is logged in
- The user is currently connected as an SSH session
- The variable `show_always` is set to true

::: tip

SSH connection is detected by checking environment variables `SSH_CONNECTION`, `SSH_CLIENT`, and `SSH_TTY`. If your SSH host does not set up these variables, one workaround is to set one of them with a dummy value.

## Custom commands

The `custom` modules show the output of some arbitrary commands.

These modules will be shown if any of the following conditions are met:

- The current directory contains a file whose name is in `files`
- The current directory contains a directory whose name is in `directories`
- The current directory contains a file whose extension is in `extensions`
- The `when` command returns 0

::: tip

Multiple custom modules can be defined by using a `.`.

:::

::: tip

The order in which custom modules are shown can be individually set by including `${custom.foo}` in the top level `format` (as it includes a dot, you need to use `${...}`). By default, the `custom` module will simply show all custom modules in the order they were defined.

:::

::: tip

[Issue #1252](https://github.com/starship/starship/discussions/1252) contains examples of custom modules. If you have an interesting example not covered there, feel free to share it there!

| symbol    | Mirrors the value of option `symbol`   |
| style\* | Mirrors the value of option `style`    |

\*: This variable can only be used as a part of a style string

#### Custom command shell

`shell` accepts a non-empty list of strings, where:

- The first string is the path to the shell to use to execute the command.
- Other following arguments are passed to the shell.

If unset, it will fallback to STARSHIP_SHELL and then to "sh" on Linux, and "cmd /C" on Windows.

The `command` will be passed in on stdin.

If `shell` is not given or only contains one element and Starship detects PowerShell will be used, the following arguments will automatically be added: `-NoProfile -Command -`. This behavior can be avoided by explicitly passing arguments to the shell, e.g.

```toml
shell = ["pwsh", "-Command", "-"]
```

::: warning Make sure your custom shell configuration exits gracefully

If you set a custom command, make sure that the default Shell used by starship will properly execute the command with a graceful exit (via the `shell` option).

For example, PowerShell requires the `-Command` parameter to execute a one liner. Omitting this parameter might throw starship into a recursive loop where the shell might try to load a full profile environment with starship itself again and hence re-execute the custom command, getting into a never ending loop.

Parameters similar to `-NoProfile` in PowerShell are recommended for other shells as well to avoid extra loading time of a custom profile on every starship invocation.

Automatic detection of shells and proper parameters addition are currently implemented, but it's possible that not all shells are covered. [Please open an issue](https://github.com/starship/starship/issues/new/choose) with shell details and starship configuration if you hit such scenario.

### Example

```toml
# ~/.config/starship.toml

[custom.foo]
command = "echo foo"  # shows output of command
files = ["foo"]       # can specify filters
when = """ test "$HOME" == "$PWD" """
format = " transcending [$output]($style)"

[custom.time]
command = "time /T"
files = ["*.pst"]
shell = ["pwsh.exe", "-NoProfile", "-Command", "-"]
```
