  The "cargo wix" subcommand provides a variety of predefined variables available
  for customization of this template. The values for each variable are set at
  installer creation time. The following variables are available:

  TargetTriple      = The rustc target triple name.
  TargetEnv         = The rustc target environment. This is typically either
                      "msvc" or "gnu" depending on the toolchain downloaded and
                      installed.
  TargetVendor      = The rustc target vendor. This is typically "pc", but Rust
                      does support other vendors, like "uwp".
  CargoTargetBinDir = The complete path to the binary (exe). The default would
                      be "target\release\<BINARY_NAME>.exe" where
                      "<BINARY_NAME>" is replaced with the name of each binary
                      target defined in the package's manifest (Cargo.toml). If
                      a different rustc target triple is used than the host,
                      i.e. cross-compiling, then the default path would be
                      "target\<CARGO_TARGET>\<CARGO_PROFILE>\<BINARY_NAME>.exe",
                      where "<CARGO_TARGET>" is replaced with the "CargoTarget"
                      variable value and "<CARGO_PROFILE>" is replaced with the
                      value from the `CargoProfile` variable.
  CargoTargetDir    = The path to the directory for the build artifacts, i.e.
                      "target".
  CargoProfile      = Either "debug" or `release` depending on the build
                      profile. The default is "release".
  Version           = The version for the installer. The default is the
                      "Major.Minor.Fix" semantic versioning number of the Rust
                      package.

                      Enabling the license sidecar file in the installer is a four step process:

                      1. Uncomment the `Component` tag and its contents.
                      2. Change the value for the `Source` attribute in the `File` tag to a path
                         to the file that should be included as the license sidecar file. The path
                         can, and probably should be, relative to this file.
                      3. Change the value for the `Name` attribute in the `File` tag to the
                         desired name for the file when it is installed alongside the `bin` folder
                         in the installation directory. This can be omitted if the desired name is
                         the same as the file name.
                      4. Uncomment the `ComponentRef` tag with the Id attribute value of "License"
                         further down in this file.
